## Local portability changes

The bundled SMAUG-T sources use unsigned intermediate arithmetic in
`cbits/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/dg.c`,
`cbits/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/indcpa.c`, and
`cbits/third_party/SMAUG-T/src/poly.c` to preserve the reference
implementation's 16-bit results without relying on undefined signed left
shifts. All SMAUG-T and TiMER outputs remain byte-for-byte validated against
the referenced known-answer test vectors. The SMAUG-T fixed-weight sampler
also uses size-correct loop indices to avoid signed/unsigned comparison
warnings without changing algorithm outputs.
